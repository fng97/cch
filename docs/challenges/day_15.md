🎄 Day 15: The Password Validator
=================================

_There had been a few naughty incidents where mischievous users had tinkered with other children's wish lists, not respecting the goodwill and spirit of the platform. It was clear: the website needed to add a layer of security to protect the integrity of each child's wish list._

_The team behind the scenes, a dedicated crew of Santa's tech-savvy elves (led by you), rolled up their sleeves. They decided to implement a homemade password validation system that ensured that no Grinch could easily guess or crack the password._

⭐ Task 1: Naughty or Nice Strings
---------------------------------

Now that children can sign up to the letter sending website, we need an endpoint for validating their passwords.

Create an endpoint at `/15/nice` that accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing a password string to validate.

The rules at this endpoint are:

* **Nice Strings**: Must contain at least three vowels (`aeiouy`), at least one letter that appears twice in a row, and must not contain the substrings: `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`.
* **Naughty Strings**: Do not meet the criteria for nice strings.

Return an appropriate HTTP status code and message (see below) indicating whether the provided string is nice or naughty.

### 🔔 Tips

Use Rust's string and char methods or [regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex) for validation.

### 💠 Examples

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/15/nice \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"input": "hello there"}'
    
    # 200 OK
    {"result":"nice"}
    

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/15/nice \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"input": "abcd"}'
    
    # 400 Bad Request
    {"result":"naughty"}
    

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/15/nice \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{Grinch? GRINCH!}'
    
    # 400 Bad Request
    # response body does not matter

🎁 Task 2: Game of the Year (400 bonus points)
----------------------------------------------

Santa thought this validation thing was so fun that it could be turned into a game!

Add a similar endpoint, POST `/15/game`, that has this set of rules:

* **Nice Strings**: Must adhere to all the rules:
  * Rule 1: must be at least 8 characters long
  * Rule 2: must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits
  * Rule 3: must contain at least 5 digits
  * Rule 4: all _integers_ (sequences of consecutive digits) in the string must add up to 2023
  * Rule 5: must contain the letters `j`, `o`, and `y` in that order and in no other order
  * Rule 6: must contain a letter that repeats with exactly one other letter between them (like `xyx`)
  * Rule 7: must contain at least one unicode character in the range `[U+2980, U+2BFF]`
  * Rule 8: must contain at least one emoji
  * Rule 9: the hexadecimal representation of the sha256 hash of the string must end with an `a`
* **Naughty Strings**: Do not meet the criteria for nice strings.

Check the string for the rules in the listed order. Return the corresponding status code and reason (and naughty/nice result) based on which rule was violated:

Rule broken

1

`8 chars`

2

8

### 💠 Examples

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/15/game \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"input": "password"}'
    
    # 400 Bad Request
    {"result":"naughty","reason":"more types of chars"}
    

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/15/game \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"input": "Password12345"}'
    
    # 400 Bad Request
    {"result":"naughty","reason":"math is hard"}
    

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/15/game \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"input": "23jPassword2000y"}'
    
    # 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
    {"result":"naughty","reason":"illegal: no sandwich"}
