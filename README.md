# Christmas Code Hunt 🎄

My solutions to [`shuttle`'s Christmas Code Hunt](https://www.shuttle.rs/cch)!

This is my first project using Rust. I started it as I was finishing [Zero to Production in Rust](https://zero2prod.com) by Luca Palmieri. I really enjoyed the book and almost every part of this project draws from it. Thanks, Luca!

I've copied across the challenge prompts for reference [here](docs/challenges).

What I'm using:

- 🦀 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) ✨
- 🕸️ [Actix Web](https://actix.rs) for the API
- 🚀 [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs) for infrastructure
- 🐳 [Dev Container](https://containers.dev) for development
- 🪄 [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD

I had a lot of fun with this but it was a lot more time-consuming than I expected! I'm going to park it for now. Here's where I left it!

```bash
root ➜ /workspaces/cch (main) $ cch23-validator --all
