# Christmas Code Hunt 🎄

My solutions to [`shuttle`'s Christmas Code Hunt](https://www.shuttle.rs/cch)!

I've copied across the challenge prompts for reference [here](docs/challenges).

What I'm using:

- 🦀 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for *fun* ✨
- 🕸️ [Actix Web](https://actix.rs) for the API
- 🚀 [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs) for infrastructure
- 🐳 [Dev Container](https://containers.dev) for development
- 🪄 [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD

TODO: Add helper middleware for use with `cch23-validator` that captures all
inputs and outputs and if the outputs were correct.
